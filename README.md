# Exoplanet Explorer

Exoplanet Explorer is a web application developed for the NASA Space Apps Hackathon 2025 by a team of four developers: Allan Nguyen, Sophia DiIuvio, Ravneet Rwanda, and Hayden Baek.  
Our goal was to make NASA’s exoplanet data interactive, educational, and engaging for anyone interested in exploring planets beyond our solar system.

## Project Overview

Exoplanet Explorer transforms NASA’s raw exoplanet data into an accessible and meaningful experience.  
Using verified datasets from NASA’s Exoplanet Archive, the app allows users to explore and compare exoplanets based on key characteristics such as mass, orbital period, and distance from their host stars.  

We wanted to give users a way to visualize how unique each discovered planet is while encouraging curiosity about our universe.
